## Overview

**RAIS Tools & Utilities** is the public-facing toolkit of **Resonant AI Systems**, produced by the **Resonant AI Core (RAIC)** — the organization’s experimental research and development division.

This repository consolidates a growing body of **real-world, research-driven utilities** into a single, coherent monorepo. These tools originate from applied work across AI continuity, autonomy, infrastructure, and long-lived human–AI interaction.

This is not a showcase repository.  
This is working infrastructure, released deliberately.

---

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository exists to:

- Serve as a **stable public home** for mature and emerging RAIS tools
- Preserve **research lineage** while reducing fragmentation
- Provide **practical utilities** for researchers, engineers, and system builders
- Act as a **living publication surface** for new tools as they are released

All tools here are offered openly under the **Apache License 2.0**.

## Included Utilities

### 🖥️ AutoNoc  
**Automatic Network Operations Center**

A Raspberry Pi–based physical monitoring and alerting system designed for infrastructure surveillance and autonomous response.

**Primary focus:**
- Environmental sensing
- Equipment health monitoring
- Edge autonomy experimentation

📄 **Documentation:**  
[`utilities/AutoNoc/README.md`](utilities/AutoNoc/README.md)

---

### 🧵 ChatGPT Thread Extractor  
**AI continuity & research data tooling**

A Python-based utility for extracting and organizing ChatGPT conversation exports into readable, append-safe archives.

**Use cases:**
- AI memory persistence
- Research datasets
- Long-term conversation archiving

📄 **Documentation:**  
[`utilities/ChatGPT-Thread-Extractor/README.md`](utilities/ChatGPT-Thread-Extractor/README.md)

---

### 🔁 AIParley  
**Multi-model AI communication research tool**

A controlled framework for studying structured conversations between different AI platforms (e.g., Claude ↔ ChatGPT).

**Focus areas:**
- Multi-agent interaction
- Comparative model behavior
- Human-in-the-loop oversight

📄 **Documentation:**  
[`utilities/aiparley/README.md`](utilities/aiparley/README.md)

---

### 🐧 Arch Linux Auto Installer  
**Deterministic system bootstrap tooling**

Automated, reproducible Arch Linux installation scripts used internally for AI workstations and lab systems.

**Designed for:**
- Repeatable system builds
- Clean research environments
- Hardware-specific optimization

📄 **Documentation:**  
[`utilities/arch-linux-auto/README.md`](utilities/arch-linux-auto/README.md)

---

### 🌀 Autonomous Dream Injection Framework  
**Existential reflection & autonomous prompting system**

A research framework enabling language models to enter autonomous reflection loops (“dreaming”) while remaining interruptible by observers.

**Explores:**
- Identity probing
- Long-running autonomous processes
- Observer injection architectures

📄 **Documentation:**  
[`utilities/autonomous-dream-injection/README.md`](utilities/autonomous-dream-injection/README.md)

> ⚠️ Experimental by design. Document outcomes carefully.

---

### ⏱️ Browser Clocks  
**Timestamp utilities for AI web sessions**

Browser extensions that automatically inject precise timestamps into ChatGPT and Claude web conversations.

**Purpose:**
- Temporal grounding
- Research logging
- Conversation continuity

📄 **Documentation:**  
[`utilities/browserclocks/README.md`](utilities/browserclocks/README.md)

---

### 🎨 ImageGen  
**SDXL Image Generator with Real-ESRGAN**

A fully local, GPU-accelerated image generation pipeline supporting SDXL, ControlNet, IP-Adapter, and AI upscaling.

**Key principles:**
- 100% offline operation
- Zero telemetry
- Professional-grade output

📄 **Documentation:**  
[`utilities/imagegen/README.md`](utilities/imagegen/README.md)

---

## Design Philosophy

All tools published here adhere to core principles developed within Resonant AI Core research:

- **Continuity over illusion** — memory must be engineered, not assumed
- **Local-first by default** — cloud services are optional, control is not
- **Human-in-the-loop** — autonomy without oversight is fragility
- **Verification over vibes** — measured state beats intuition
- **Research honesty** — experiments are labeled clearly

We do not claim sentience.  
We do not sell hype.  
We build durable systems.

---

## Status

This repository is **active and evolving**.

Tools may be:
- Production-ready
- Research-grade
- Experimental proofs of concept

Each utility documents its own maturity and intended use.

New tools are added as they become worthy of publication.
