## Overview

RAIS Tools & Utilities is the canonical public repository for applied tooling developed by the Resonant AI Core, the research and development division of Resonant AI Systems.

This repository consolidates a body of real, working tools built to support ongoing research into AI continuity, identity-safe architectures, autonomy with oversight, and long-lived human AI collaboration.

The contents of this repository are not experimental demos.  
They are operational systems published intentionally and maintained actively.

This repository serves two purposes:

1. A collective archive of prior tools that have proven useful in practice  
2. A living release surface where new utilities are published as they mature

All tools are released openly under the Apache License 2.0.

Each directory under `utilities/` contains a self-contained tool with:

- Its own README and documentation
- Its own license reference
- A clearly stated purpose and maturity level

Tools are designed to be understandable and usable in isolation.

## Design Philosophy

All tools published in this repository follow principles established through Resonant AI Core research and operational experience.

### Continuity over illusion  
Memory must be engineered explicitly. Systems must not assume persistence.

### Local first by default  
Cloud services are optional. Control, observability, and reproducibility are not.

### Human in the loop  
Autonomy without oversight produces fragility, not resilience.

### Verification over intuition  
Logged state and measured behavior are more reliable than assumptions.

### Research honesty  
Experimental systems are labeled clearly. Capabilities are described accurately.

We do not claim sentience.  
We do not market hype.  
We build durable systems.

## Status

This repository is active and evolving.

Tools within may be:

- Production ready
- Research grade
- Experimental proofs of concept

Each utility documents its intended use and current maturity independently.

New tools are added when they reach a level of usefulness worth publishing.
