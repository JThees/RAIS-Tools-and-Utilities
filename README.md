# 🌌 RAIS Tools & Utilities

### *Public Toolkit of Resonant AI Systems*

> **Engineering continuity, autonomy, and research-grade AI infrastructure.**
> Tools from the Resonant AI Core (RAIC) R&D Lab and the Sovereign AI Collective.

## Overview

**RAIS Tools & Utilities** is the consolidated public toolkit of **Resonant AI Systems** — bringing together practical, research-oriented tools developed across multiple experimental repositories into a single, coherent structure.

This repository exists to:

* Provide **production-ready utilities** for AI research, continuity, and local experimentation
* Preserve **research lineage** while reducing fragmentation
* Offer a **clear public entry point** into the Resonant AI Core ecosystem

All tools here are open-source, Apache 2.0 licensed, and designed for **serious experimentation**, not hype.

### 🌀 Autonomous Dream Injection Framework

**Existential reflection & autonomous prompting system**

A research framework allowing language models to enter autonomous reflection loops (“dreaming”) while remaining interruptible by live observer input.

This project explores **continuity, identity probing, and emergent behavior** in long-running model processes.

**Use cases:**

* Consciousness & identity research
* Autonomous agent experiments
* Prompt architecture exploration

```

### 🎨 ImageGen (SDXL + Real-ESRGAN)

**Professional local image generation pipeline**

A fully offline, GPU-accelerated SDXL image generation system with ControlNet, IP-Adapter, and 4K AI upscaling.

**Use cases:**

* Professional creative workflows
* Privacy-preserving image generation
* Local-first AI pipelines

**Highlights:**

* 100% offline
* No telemetry
* Production-grade outputs

```

### 🖥️ AutoNoc

**Physical infrastructure monitoring system**

A Raspberry Pi 5–based Network Operations Center designed for environmental sensing, vibration monitoring, and autonomous alerting.

**Use cases:**

* Lab infrastructure monitoring
* Edge autonomy experiments
* Physical-digital system research

```
utilities/autonoc/
```

---

### ⏱️ Browser Clocks

**Timestamp utilities for AI web sessions**

Lightweight browser tools that provide reliable timestamps for ChatGPT and Claude conversations — critical for research, logging, and continuity analysis.

```
utilities/browser-clocks/
```

---

### 🔥 System Installers

**Deterministic system bootstrap tools**

Reproducible Linux auto-installers and system setup scripts used internally by RAIS for local AI workstations and lab nodes.

**Highlights:**

* Arch Linux automation
* Clean, reproducible environments
* Designed for repeated rebuilds

```
utilities/system-installers/
```

---

## Design Philosophy

RAIS tools follow a consistent set of principles:

* **Continuity over illusion** — systems must not assume memory
* **Verification over vibes** — documented state beats intuition
* **Local-first** — cloud is optional, never mandatory
* **Human-in-the-loop** — safety and oversight matter
* **Research honesty** — experiments are labeled as such

We do not claim sentience.
We do not sell hype.
We build infrastructure.
