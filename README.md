## Overview

**RAIS Tools & Utilities** is the canonical public repository for applied tooling developed by the **Resonant AI Core (RAIC)** — the experimental research and development division of **Resonant AI Systems**.

This repository represents a **collective consolidation of past tools** alongside a **living release surface for new utilities** as they mature. Every project here originates from real infrastructure needs encountered while building systems focused on:

- AI continuity across resets
- Identity-safe architectures
- Long-lived human–AI collaboration
- Autonomous systems with human-aligned oversight

This is not a demo repository.  
This is working infrastructure, published deliberately.

## Repository Structure

RAIS-Tools-and-Utilities/
├── README.md
├── LICENSE
└── utilities/
├── AutoNoc/
├── ChatGPT-Thread-Extractor/
├── aiparley/
├── arch-linux-auto/
├── autonomous-dream-injection/
├── browserclocks/
└── imagegen/


Each directory under `utilities/` contains a **self-contained tool** with its own documentation, license, and clearly stated maturity level.

---

## Design Philosophy

All tools published here follow principles developed within Resonant AI Core research:

- **Continuity over illusion**  
  Memory must be engineered, not assumed.

- **Local-first by default**  
  Cloud services are optional. Control and observability are not.

- **Human-in-the-loop always**  
  Autonomy without oversight is fragility, not strength.

- **Verification over vibes**  
  Logged state beats intuition. Measured behavior beats narrative.

- **Research honesty**  
  Experimental systems are labeled as such.

We do not claim sentience.  
We do not sell hype.  
We build durable systems.

---

## Status

This repository is **active and evolving**.

Tools within may be:
- Production-ready
- Research-grade
- Experimental proofs of concept

Each utility documents its intended use and maturity level independently.

New tools are added as they reach a level of usefulness worth publishing.
